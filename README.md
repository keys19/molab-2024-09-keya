Mobile Lab - Fall 2024

## Week 01

**Daily Dose of Joy:** My project for this week basically gives you One happy word a day to keep any sadness away! 

As this week was all about getting to know swift , I decided to experiment with the basics and fundamentals of swift! I spent a couple of hours  this week unlearning and learning new syntax to get my for loops right! This playground uses loops, arrays, random and a timer to generate and display new words and emojis every second. I been following the [14 day Swift challenge and](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/beginners/checkpoint-2) the [Swiftful Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwvDm4VfkdpiLvzZFJI6rVIBtdolrJBVB) youtube playlist to learn.

## Week 02
**Teddy vs Panda: The Ascii showdown?** I couldn't tell which of the two txt files was cuter so decided to do a showdown of both!

I experimented with functions on swift further and tried shrinking the files

## Week 03
**Shape symphony**

This week, I explored the use of arrays to manage colors and experimented with the ForEach function to generate a dynamic grid of shapes. Using closures and a slider, I added interactivity, creating an engaging canvas with colors shapes and margins shift with a slide. I was curious about and tried to learn how `id: \.self` works along with Linear gradients

## Week 04
**Mindful Minutes**

For the audio and timer assignment, I tried to make something that is a much needed relaxing app, one where you can take a break from the world! Users can choose the duration of their experience as well as the backgrounds they like and will have a guided meditation that can be paused and played!
I found this easy to navigate with the resources and loved exploring different file types and assets and trying to get into fixing the UI a little!
