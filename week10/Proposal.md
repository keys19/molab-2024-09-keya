# Final Project Proposal
When we're stressed, overwhelmed, or in need of support, we often turn to therapists and caregivers. But when they're the ones feeling drained or burdened, who do they turn to?

Just as we’ve come to normalize seeking therapy and care for ourselves, it’s time we recognize the same need for caregivers. (AppName) is here to bridge that gap, catering to those who dedicate their lives to supporting others. With warmth, empathy, and an understanding of their unique challenges, (AppName) becomes the safe space for caregivers to return to—a place to recharge, find solace, and be cared for, after each long, selfless day.

Features:

- **Mood-to-Meditation Visualizer**
    - Since I spent many of my weekly homeworks to create and improve on a meditation app, Its time to make one that’ll actually serve a purpose. A feature where caregivers input their mood, which generates a unique visual and auditory experience designed to relax and soothe. Based on mood entries, different animations and soundscapes provide an immediate escape.
    - **Implementation**:
        - **SpriteKit:** For visually appealing animations that correspond with moods.
        - **AVFoundation**: To play relaxing audio that complements each mood visual.
        - **CoreML**: For mood recognition if using text entries.
- **Caregiver Success Moments & Gratitude Journal**
    - A reflective journal where caregivers can log positive moments or “wins” of the day. It encourages reflection and gratitude, enhancing self-worth and mental positivity after a long and tiring day.
    - **Implementation**:
        - **Firebase Storage**: To store text and media entries privately.
- **Time Off Scheduler & Sub Support**
    - Allows caregivers to (mandatorily) schedule “time-off” reminders and even provides options for locating respite care resources or backup support options - a much needed space for caregivers themselves.
    - **Implementation**:
        - **DatePicker and Calendar APIs**: For scheduling reminders.
        - **Firebase Firestore**: To store schedule preferences and manage reminders.
    
    Along with these features, I want to focus on the UI of the app to make it homely and reflect the warmth. I get overly ambitious while thinking about ideas and so have I here but promising myself to allow flexibility and room for any of these features to take a better shape along the way.
